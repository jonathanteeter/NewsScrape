# NewsScrape

## Introduction
This is a full-stack News application that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. The application uses Cheerio to scrape the news and a NoSQL Mongoose database. 

## What the project does
The application allows the user to pull (scrape) the latest news headlines where Headline, Summary, and URL are provided.  The user can select the news story of interest, click on the URL, and read the full article.  The user can also save an article and leave comment on the latest news.

## Why the project is useful
* Project uses a NoSQL database:
    * MongoDB is a database that allows you to store documents with a dynamic structure inside a collection.
    * Mongoose Model is then mapped to a MongoDB Document via the Model's schema definition.
    
* Key technologies used to build this app are:
    * Bootstrap (Responsive Front-end framework)
    * Handlebars (Front-end templating engine)
    * Express.js (Server framework)
    * Node.js (Server-side JavaScript environment)
    * MongoDB (NoSQL DB)
    * Mongoose (Provides schemas for database collections)
    * Cheerio 
    * Heroku (Cloud Application Platform)

## Challenges
* Setting up the routes and getting the data to render to the screen was a challenge.
* Understanding promises was also a challenge.
